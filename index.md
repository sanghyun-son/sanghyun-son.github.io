I am a Ph.D student majoring in computer vision at SNU computer vision lab, advised by [Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/kmlee/).


## **Research Interests**

I am interested in deep learning and low-level image restoration problems, especially **image super-resolution** and **deblurring**.
Recently I mainly working on reconstructing high-resolution images from real-world inputs.
My research topics also include network optimization and acceleration to handle practical issues in deep learning.


## **News**

- One paper got accepted to **[CVPR 2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/)**!
  - **Sanghyun Son** and Kyoung Mu Lee, "SRWarp: Generalized Image Super-Resolution under Arbitrary Transformation."

- I am co-organizing the **[6th NTIRE workshop and challenges](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire21/)** in conjunction with **[CVPR 2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/)**. Me, [Seungjun Nah](https://seungjunnah.github.io/) and Suyoung Lee are in charge of the following image deblurring and video super-resolution challenge tracks:
  - **Image Deblurring** Track 1. Low Resolution, Track 2. JPEG artifacts,
  - **Video Super-Resolution** Track 1. Spatial, Track 2. Spatio-Temporal.

- I have implemented an efficient bicubic resizing algorithm in PyTorch that is compatible with the MATLAB reference. Please check it from [here](https://github.com/sanghyun-son/bicubic_pytorch).


## Awards and Honors

- **Highly cited paper award**: Department of ECE, Seoul National University, 2018.
- **Challenge winner & Workshop best paper award**: NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution, 2017.
- **Graduated with _summa cum laude_**: B.S. in Department of ECE, Seoul National University, 2017.
