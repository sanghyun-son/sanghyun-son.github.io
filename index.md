**Ph.D candidate** \
**Affiliation**: Department of ECE, Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea \
**Email**: sonsang35(at)gmail(dot)com, thstkdgus35(at)snu(dot)ac(dot)kr \
**Google scholar**: [profile](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=nWaSdu0AAAAJ)

I am a Ph.D student majoring in computer vision at SNU computer vision lab, advised by [Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/kmlee/).


## **Research Interests**

I am interested in deep learning and low-level image restoration problems, especially **image super-resolution** and **deblurring**.
Recently I mainly working on reconstructing high-resolution images from real-world inputs.
My research topics also include network optimization and acceleration to handle practical issues in deep learning.
