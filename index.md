**Affiliation**: Computer Vision TU, AI Research Center, SAIT, **Samsung Electronics** \
**Email**: sonsang35(at)gmail(dot)com


I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of ECE, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea. \
Computer Vision Lab, Advisor: [**Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee**](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/kmlee/) \
*Thesis: Generalized Resampling Model for Practical Image Super-Resolution*


## **Research Interests**

I am interested in deep learning and low-level image restoration problems, especially **image super-resolution** and **deblurring**.
Recently I mainly working on reconstructing high-resolution images from real-world inputs.
My research topics also include network optimization and acceleration to handle practical issues in deep learning.
